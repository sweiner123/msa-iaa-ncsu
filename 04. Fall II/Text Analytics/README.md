## Text Analytics Project - Friends Screenplay Analysis

**Project Description**: We will analyze scripts from the 90s sitcom, Friends, found on Kaggle.com. Specifically, we will use topic clustering and sentiment analysis to explore the major plot themes of each season. Based on our findings about season plotlines and sentiment, we will decide and present whether Friends should be considered a “comfort show.”
